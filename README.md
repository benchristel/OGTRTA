# OGTRTA

The One Grammar... TO RULE THEM ALL!!!

...or OGTRTA, for short, is a meta-grammar for constructed languages. It's kind of like a grammar template that you can customize for your conlang.

It is designed to minimize syntactic ambiguity (think Lojban) while remaining at least somewhat naturalistic. You can dial the syntactic precision up or down to your liking.

## Inspiration

The most interesting thing about OGTRTA is probably its treatment of verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs.
OGTRTA collapses all of these parts of speech into one, _predicates_. This design decision was inspired by a series of observations about English:

- Many verbs can be either transitive or intransitive. E.g. "The bird ate the rice" &rarr; "The bird ate".
- English prepositions can lose their object and function like adverbs. We can say "Is Josh in the house?" or "Is Josh in?"
- These two derivational processes (if indeed they are derivational) look awfully similar! A word that takes a complement can lose it.
- Participles function syntactically much like prepositions. Some pairs of prepositions and participles are nearly synonymous: "I broke the rock **with** a hammer" (preposition) vs. "I broke the rock **using** a hammer" (participle).
- Adjectives can take complements, much like verbs and prepositions. "The elf is eager" &rarr; "The elf is eager to please."
- Adjectives, prepositions, and verbs can all modify nouns (the latter via relative clauses) and can be the predicate of a sentence (though English requires a copula for non-verbs).

It certainly seems like there are similarities between these parts of speech! So why not unify them?

The Celtic languages also provided a great deal of inspiration. The reference implementation of OGTRTA uses initial consonant mutations, as well as tense-marking particles similar to those in Cornish.
